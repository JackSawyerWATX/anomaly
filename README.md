# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


# Anomaly — Personal Portfolio (Early Stage)

This repository contains the starting point for a personal portfolio site built with React and Vite. The project is in early development and currently serves as the scaffold for a dynamic portfolio that will showcase projects, provide an About page, a Contact page, and link to social profiles.

## What this project will include

- A homepage / landing section showcasing an overview and a hero visual.
- A Projects page that lists portfolio projects with short descriptions, screenshots, links, and case studies.
- An About page with a short bio, skills, and background information.
- A Contact page with a form or contact details so visitors can reach out.
- Links to social profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub) prominently placed in the header/footer.

## Current status

- Project scaffolded using Vite + React.
- Basic WebGL shader renderer and UI controls are integrated (work-in-progress).
- Styling and component layout are being iterated on; accessible and responsive design is a goal.

## Tech stack

- React
- Vite
- WebGL (for shader visuals)
- Plain CSS (some files under `src/`)

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Project structure (high level)

- `index.html` — app entry
- `src/` — source files (components, styles, shaders)
- `public/` — static assets (if needed)
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies

## Next steps (planned)

- Add complete page routes for Projects, About, Contact
- Implement responsive layout and navigation
- Add content for each project with images and links
- Add SEO, accessibility improvements, and contact form handling

## Links

- LinkedIn: (add your LinkedIn URL here)
- GitHub: (add your GitHub profile URL here)

If you want, I can also:

- Add route placeholders and a simple navigation component,
- Wire up a Contact form (static or via a service like Formspree), or
- Add a small README badge and license.

Tell me which of the next steps you'd like me to implement first.

### This is going to be pretty rad for me!
### I love you all!! Keep Coding!!
